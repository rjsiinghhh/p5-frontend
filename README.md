The Zamora Project...
the idea of this project is to input your expenses, visualize it and see exactly how much your spending. It's not supposed to be anything more than just a place to input your expenses. This project definetly did not go as planned. For class, I barely scraped together a version of it I find somewhat acceptable. It's obvious where the mistakes were made and I found myself complicating code for no reason. Ive learned alot from this though, and I plan to keep it on my portfolio. However, I'm starting over completely. It will done right, the functionality will actually be there and will be written in a different language. I found this project challenging, and in all honestly I didnt pass, but, I'll do it again.
